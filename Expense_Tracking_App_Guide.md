# Expense Tracking Web App - Development Guide

## 1. Project Setup
- **Initialize the Project**:
  - Set up a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
  - Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install express mongoose next react react-dom
    ```
- **Directory Structure**:
  - Organize your project with folders for routes, models, controllers, views, and public assets.

## 2. Set Up Express Server
- Create an `index.js` or `app.js` file for your Express server.
- Set up basic routing and middleware for handling JSON and static files.
- Create a connection to your MongoDB database using Mongoose.

## 3. User Authentication & Authorization
- Implement user registration and login using JWT or sessions.
- Set up routes for user authentication (e.g., `/register`, `/login`, `/logout`).
- Protect certain routes with middleware to ensure only logged-in users can access them.

## 4. Database Schema Design
- **User Schema**: Store user information, including their budget, goals, and points.
- **Expense Schema**: Store details of each expense, including date, amount, category, and user reference.
- **Diary Entry Schema**: Store daily diary entries, including the date, content, and user reference.
- **Goal Schema**: Store details about user goals, including target amounts, timeframes, and status.

## 5. Building RESTful APIs
- **Expense Management**:
  - Create routes and controllers for adding, updating, and deleting expenses.
  - Implement APIs to fetch expenses for a specific date or range.
- **Diary Management**:
  - Create routes and controllers for writing and retrieving diary entries.
- **Goal Management**:
  - Implement routes for setting, updating, and tracking goals (daily, monthly, yearly).
- **Point System**:
  - Create logic for awarding points based on user actions (e.g., maintaining streaks, staying within budget).

## 6. Frontend with Next.js
- **Page Setup**:
  - Set up basic pages with Next.js: Home, Dashboard, Add Expense, Add Diary Entry, Goals, and Profile.
- **API Integration**:
  - Use Next.js API routes or fetch data from your Express API.
- **State Management**:
  - Consider using a state management tool like Redux or React Context for managing user state across the app.
- **UI Design**:
  - Design a user-friendly interface using a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.

## 7. Budget and Goal Tracking
- **Budget Comparison**:
  - Calculate total expenses at the end of each month and compare them with the set budget.
- **Goal Progress**:
  - Track goal completion and update the status based on user input.
- **Notifications**:
  - Notify the user if they are close to exceeding their budget or if a goal is near completion.

## 8. Streak and Point Management
- **Streak Maintenance**:
  - Implement logic to maintain streaks based on daily user activity.
  - Deduct points if a user misses a day, and break the streak if points run out.
- **Reward System**:
  - Award extra points for completing goals on time or staying within budget.

## 9. Testing and Debugging
- Test your application thoroughly for different user scenarios.
- Use tools like Postman for API testing and Jest/Mocha for unit testing your Node.js code.

## 10. Deployment
- Deploy your application on a platform like Vercel (for the frontend) and Heroku or DigitalOcean (for the backend).
- Set up environment variables for secure connections and API keys.

## 11. Future Enhancements
- Think about what happens when a streak is broken (e.g., penalties, reduced points, or motivational messages).
- Add analytics and reporting features for better user insights.
- Consider integrating with external services for budgeting, like bank APIs.

## 12. Maintenance and Updates
- Plan for regular updates and maintenance to fix bugs, add new features, and ensure security.
